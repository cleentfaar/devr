DEVGEN
========================================================================================================================
DEVGEN is my attempt at creating a handy all-in-one CLI-script aimed at developers who have to work on many
different projects for many different clients.
You may have a specific folder full of clients and (at a deeper level) their projects, and you want to keep control over
the structure while not being slowed down in the process.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please read [the installation chapter of the documentation](docs/1-Installation.md)


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please read [the commands reference of the documentation](docs/2-Commands.md)


Future improvements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm very eagerly improving the first commands so that I have a good idea of what other commands will look like.
If you have any good ideas and are willing to take it further, I'm happy to accept PRs.

Most important right now is making everything properly testable and improve the documentation.
Therefore new commands will have to come later, unfortunately.
